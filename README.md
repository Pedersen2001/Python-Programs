# Python-Programs
Repository containing different Python programs in each folder

Each folder will have a README with a description/general idea of how the program shall work.

Each folder might not have a developed program, but be merely an idea for development.


Coding conventions for pushing:
Commit Naming
Since branches is eventually deleted, we also conduct good naming of our commits.
The naming convention we use is as follows:

FEATURE: {NAME OR DESC}\
BUGFIX: {NAME OR DESC}\
REFACTOR: {NAME OR DESC}\
TEST: {NAME OR DESC}\
ADD: {NAME OR DESC OF FILES}\
DELETE: {NAME OR DESC OF FILES}\
Where the uppercase name is the keyword.\
The rest of the descriptive name is lowercase.
