Build a web scraper that extracts weather forecast data from a weather website for a given location.\
The scraper should retrieve:

Tasks to create:\
Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).\
A 5-day forecast including temperature highs and lows, and weather descriptions.\
Present the data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
Perhaps add a UI to present the information
- Could enable the possibility for the use of API.
