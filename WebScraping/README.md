# Web Scraping
Build a web scraper that extracts weather forecast data from a weather website (e.g., weather.com) for a given location. Your scraper should retrieve:

Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
A 5-day forecast including temperature highs and lows, and weather descriptions.
Present the data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
